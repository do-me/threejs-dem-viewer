# Three.js DEM viewer
A simple three.js app for viewing digital elevation models (DEM) in the browser. Purely vibe-coded, some controls not working properly atm. Basic functions do work. Texture is missing. 
Created this as simple alternative to Aerialod which is unfortunately only available for Windows.

## APP: https://do-me.github.io/threejs-dem-viewer/

Download the mont blanc png from this repo and upload it in the app.

Default settings will give you this:

Wireframe mode:

## DEMs

Grab some DEM of your choice, like EU-DEM (DD) from EEA/Eurostat/GISCO under https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/digital-elevation-model/eu-dem#Slope (Direct download link: https://gisco-services.ec.europa.eu/dem/5degree/mosaic/EU_DEM_mosaic_5deg.ZIP)

Open it in QGIS and create a screenshot of the area of your choice (or properly create a print with CTRL+P with high res).
